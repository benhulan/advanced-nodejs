### Advanced NodeJS - Samer Bruna

#### Notes:

These are sandbox NodeJS files and tests. Initializing as git repo to track changes in index.js

`node repl.js` -- launches a repl with custom settings
`node process.js` -- shows how process is an event emitter
`node buffer.js` -- shows difference between string and buffer
`node printStars.js 5 hello` -- runs a simple function
`node index.js` -- runs the same function as a required module
